# Faculty Glyphic Font Setup

To use the Faculty Glyphic font, you need to:

1. **Download the font files** from Adobe Fonts or your font provider
2. **Place the font files** in this directory (`public/fonts/`) with the following names:
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Regular.woff2`
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Regular.woff`
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Regular.ttf`
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Bold.woff2`
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Bold.woff`
   - `FacultyGlyphic-Bold.ttf`

3. The font will automatically be applied globally across the application.

**Alternative: Using Adobe Fonts**

If you have an Adobe Fonts subscription, you can:
1. Add the font to your Adobe Fonts project
2. Get the embed code from Adobe Fonts
3. Add it to `index.html` in the `<head>` section

The font is already configured in `src/index.css` and will be applied globally once the font files are in place.
